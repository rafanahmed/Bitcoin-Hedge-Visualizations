    "# Bitcoin as \"Digital Gold\"? A Visual Analysis of Its Role as a Hedge Against Inflation and Market Volatility\n",
    "\n",
    "As inflation creates general unease within our economy, we're seeing a rise in investments into alternative commodities and assets that are said to \"hedge\"—an investment that's expected to hold or increase its value over time, even as the cost of everything else goes up. One of these assets is Bitcoin ($BTC), a cryptocurrency often dubbed \"Digital Gold\" based on popular sentiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "As governments printed significant amounts of money, especially in recent years, many investors have looked for assets that can protect their wealth from the resulting inflation. Proponents claim Bitcoin, with its fixed supply, is a perfect candidate. A good hedge should ideally be stable, but what if Bitcoin becomes more chaotic and unpredictable precisely when you need it to be a safe haven? This project explores and investigates this popular claim by asking the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Does Bitcoin's volatility change during periods of high vs. low inflation?**\n",
    "- **During major stock market crashes, does Bitcoin act as a 'safe haven' by holding its value, or does it crash even harder?**\n",
    "- **How does Bitcoin’s performance change during spikes in market-wide fear and uncertainty, and does it behave more like gold (a hedge) or the S&P 500 (a risk asset)?**\n",
    "- **Does Bitcoin behave like a hedge or a risk asset when U.S. interest rates (DFF) rise or fall, and how does its response compare to gold and the S&P 500?**"

    "## Mining Metrics: Sourcing Our Datasets\n",
    "Several key financial and economic datasets are needed to investigate the relationship between Bitcoin, inflation, and broader market behavior. The following data was sourced from Yahoo Finance (via the `yfinance` library) and the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Bitcoin (BTC-USD)**\n",
    "> This dataset contains the daily price history of Bitcoin valued in U.S. Dollars, which is central to evaluating its performance as an asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Source:** Yahoo Finance (`yfinance` Ticker: BTC-USD)\n",

    "    - **Volume:** The total number of Bitcoins traded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. S&P 500 Index (^GSPC)**\n",
    "> This data tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly-traded companies in the United States, offering a snapshot of the overall health of the U.S. stock market. This is essential for analyzing how Bitcoin behaves during broad market movements and crashes.\n",

    "\n",
    "**3. CBOE Volatility Index (^VIX)**\n",

    "- **pandas_ta**: A library of technical analysis indicators. While not heavily used here, it’s useful for calculating moving averages, volatility, or other trading metrics if needed.  \n",
    "- **numpy**: Provides fast numerical operations, which support calculations like cumulative returns, percentage changes, and other array-based computations.  \n",
    "- **datetime**: Used to handle and manipulate dates. This is essential for aligning datasets on a common timeline, resampling data into weekly or monthly periods, and clearly defining event windows.\n",
    "- **matplotlib**: A versatile plotting library for building visualizations. We use it for detailed control over charts, adding labels, annotations, and customizing plots.  \n",
    "- **seaborn**: A visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. We use it to create clean, high-level statistical plots (boxplots, bar charts, and line graphs).  \n",
    "\n",
    "To keep our analysis consistent across all datasets, we first resample the raw CPI data to a clean monthly frequency (`MS`). From this standardized monthly series, we are then able to calculate the year-over-year (YoY) inflation rate. This transformation allows us to directly compare inflation trends with the financial assets (Bitcoin, S&P 500, and Gold) on the same timeline, ensuring that our results reflect meaningful economic shifts."

This dollar value is then divided by the closing price to express volatility as a percentage, making it consistent and comparable.\n",

    "\n",
    "A core tenet of the \"Digital Gold\" thesis is that Bitcoin should act as a stable store of value, particularly when economic conditions are uncertain. This section puts that idea to the test by investigating a key question: Does Bitcoin's price stability/volatility change during periods of high inflation?\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide a clear answer, we first analyze Bitcoin's performance in isolation. We grouped the data into three distinct inflation environments: Low (<2%), Moderate (2-5%), and High (>5%). A bar chart visualizes the average 30-day volatility—measured by the Normalized Average True Range (ATR)—for Bitcoin within each environment."

This trend suggests that, contrary to the idea of it being a stable haven, Bitcoin's price becomes progressively less stable and more volatile as inflationary pressures increase."

Rather than acting as a stabilizing force, the data reveals that Bitcoin becomes progressively more chaotic and unpredictable as inflationary pressures rise. This behavior is in stark contrast to that of Gold, which maintained low volatility across all environments. Ultimately, the findings suggest that during the very times an investor might seek a stable safe haven from inflation, Bitcoin's own price instability intensifies, challenging its effectiveness in that role."

    "A primary argument for Bitcoin is its potential to serve as a 'safe haven'—an asset expected to retain or even increase its value during a stock market downturn. This analysis directly investigates this claim by visually comparing Bitcoin's performance against the S&P 500 during periods of significant market stress. We begin with a long-term view of their cumulative returns to establish context, before zooming in on two critical case studies: the acute, rapid panic of the March 2020 COVID-19 crash and the sustained pressure of the 2022 bear market."

This is visually evident in the much sharper peaks and deeper drawdowns of the Bitcoin line compared to the relatively smoother growth of the stock market.

In the short-lived COVID-19 panic of March 2020, Bitcoin initially plunged even harder than equities but then staged a rapid and powerful rebound, ultimately outperforming the S&P 500. In contrast, during the prolonged 2022 bear market, Bitcoin suffered a far steeper and more sustained decline, losing over half its value while the S&P 500 experienced a more moderate drawdown.  \n",

In other words, it tends to drop when overall risk sentiment turns negative, often by a larger amount than traditional stocks. Its eventual performance depends on the type of downturn: if the shock is short-lived, Bitcoin can bounce back quickly as speculative interest returns; but if the downturn drags on, it struggles to recover and remains suppressed.\n",

    "To test Bitcoin's ability to be a hedge, we turn to the VIX, often called the “fear index.” The VIX measures expected market volatility by tracking option prices (contracts that let investors bet on or protect against future price moves) on the S&P 500, making it one of the most widely used gauges of investor anxiety and uncertainty.  \n",

    "In this section, we focus on periods when the VIX is elevated—moments of heightened fear—and compare the performance of Bitcoin, gold, and the S&P 500. To visualize this, we construct cumulative return indices (growth of \\$1) and overlay shaded regions during high-VIX episodes.

    "Another important question for Bitcoin’s role as “Digital Gold” is how it reacts when U.S. interest rates change. Interest rates here are measured by the Effective Federal Funds Rate (DFF), which is the short-term rate banks charge each other for overnight loans. The Federal Reserve adjusts this rate as part of its monetary policy: raising it usually means borrowing money becomes more expensive (tightening financial conditions), while lowering it makes borrowing cheaper (loosening financial conditions).  \n",

    "To answer this, we build a bar chart of average weekly returns under two regimes: when interest rates are above their median (high-rate) and when they are below (low-rate). For each regime, we calculate the average return of Bitcoin, gold, and the S&P 500. If Bitcoin behaves like gold, its returns should stay steady across regimes; if it behaves like a risk asset, its returns should drop during high-rate periods.  "
